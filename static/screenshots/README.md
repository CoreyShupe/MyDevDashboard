# Screenshot gallery

A visual index of every screen in the dashboard, one folder per feature. Each image is a
`DEV_VIEW` mock render (no database, no hand-entered data) captured with `dev-dash shot`, so it
shows a real, current frame of that flow. Browse here to see what any flow looks like at a
glance.

**This is a maintained artifact** — when a flow's look changes, its screenshot must be
recaptured in the same change. The rules, the full view↔file map, and the regen commands live in
[AGENTS.md §11](../AGENTS.md). Filenames match the `DEV_VIEW` key exactly (§8).

Regenerate everything (from the repo root):

```bash
./dev-dash shot <DEV_VIEW> screenshots/<feature>/<DEV_VIEW>.png   # one view
# e.g. ./dev-dash shot projects screenshots/projects/projects.png
```

## home

The cross-feature **Overview** — the app's landing tab. An at-a-glance roll-up: summary tiles,
recent tickets, open todos, repos needing attention, and loose notes.

| Overview with no data yet (every section empty) | `home-empty` |
